# WordCamp Raleigh 2017 Artwork
The following repo contains the proposed artwork for WordCamp Raleigh 2017, including original editable files.

## Concept and Meaning
Raleigh, NC is known as the "City of Oaks" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. It seems fitting for the WordCamp Raleigh 2017's visual representation and branding to pay tribute to it's host city's nickname, while also utilizing a character known throughout the WordPress community as "Wapuu".

"Wapuu", initially the official character of [ja.wordpress.org](ja.wordpress.org), was designed by [Kazuko Kaneuchi](http://blog.cgfm.jp/mutsuki/) under GPL v2 license or any later version. Since the initial release of Wapuu, [many unique versions](http://jawordpressorg.github.io/wapuu/) of the beloved character have been created.

### Introducing Squirrel Wapuu
WordCamp Raleigh 2017 will be introducing a new character to the Wapuu family, named "[Squirrel Wapuu](https://github.com/allenmoore/WordCampRaleigh2017Artwork/raw/master/WordCampRaleigh2017-Logo.png)". Squirrel Wapuu, also named after the state mammal of North Carolina, can be seen holding a WordPress branded acorn.

## Sticker Design
WordCamp Raleigh 2017's sticker will feature a hexagon design with green colors for the background, border, and font, that are complimentary to the browns in Squirrel Wapuu.

The sticker design, located in the `sticker` folder, includes color palette files with RGBA color definitions for each color utilized in the sticker.

The font utilized for the typography is [Biko by Marco Ugolini](http://www.dafont.com/biko.font) from [dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com).
